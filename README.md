# html-email-intro

Reflection: Coding for html emails can be pretty confusing. Instead of linking to an external style sheet for styles, all styles must be written using only html; 
meaning the <table>, <tr>, and <td> elements need to be used instead of our normal method of using <div> to handle containers and whatnot. Most of the web browsers 
are not compatble with external stylesheets -- namely Google. There are others that are not compatible with external style sheets for css, but most of this is due
to google being incompatible. Using concepts like table data <td>, table rows <tr> and tables <table> in general help developers achieve desiging an email 
that can be sent out without having an issue with incompatibility issues.
